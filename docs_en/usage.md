## Best Practices

### 1. Document Preparation

**Document Quality**
- Use clear, high-quality PDF documents.
- Ensure that text can be copied and searched normally.
- Avoid documents that are purely images.

**Document Organization**
- Upload documents classified by medical specialty.
- Use meaningful filenames.
- Add appropriate metadata tags.

### 2. Query Optimization

**Querying Techniques**
- Use specific and clear medical terms.
- Avoid overly broad or vague questions.
- You can include key information such as symptoms, disease names, drug names, etc.

**Multi-turn Conversation**
- Use the session context for in-depth inquiries.
- You can ask for clarification or additional information.
- Supports follow-up questions on related details.

### 3. Result Verification

**Information Verification**
- Check the reliability of the cited sources.
- Compare information from multiple relevant documents.
- Pay attention to the confidence score.

**Professional Judgment**
- The information provided by the system is for reference only.
- Important medical decisions should be made in consultation with a professional doctor.
- Regularly update the document library to get the latest information.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1.  **Document Upload Fails**
    - Check the file format and size.
    - Confirm a stable network connection.
    - Check the backend logs for error messages.

2.  **Query Returns No Results**
    - Confirm that relevant documents have been uploaded and processed successfully.
    - Try using different keywords.
    - Lower the similarity threshold.

3.  **Slow Response Time**
    - Check system resource usage.
    - Consider reducing the number of retrieved documents.
    - Optimize the query phrasing.

### Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics**
- Query response time.
- Document processing speed.
- System resource utilization.
- Retrieval accuracy.

**Optimization Recommendations**
- Regularly clean up unused documents.
- Monitor memory and storage usage.
- Adjust configuration parameters based on usage.
